Data and Code for Mbiol Thesis: 
----------
This repository contains all the data and code for the phylogenies and statistical analysis presented in my Master's thesis.
There are two folders. Each folder contains data and a quarto file containing annotated code for my analysis:
1. Pipeline for phylogeny generation
2. r Code for map generation
   
(For map generation, the whole folder should be downloaded and the working directory set to 'here' in order to run the code.)
